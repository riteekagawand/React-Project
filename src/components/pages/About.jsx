          <h3>
            Music has always been my passion. Growing up, I was inspired by legendary artists like Lata Mangeshkar and also by the incredible talent of the underrated Shilpa Rao. Her unique voice, powerful lyrics and innovative sound have always resonated with me. In 2018, I decided to pursue my dream of making music and haven't looked back since.
